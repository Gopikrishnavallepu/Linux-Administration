# Users and groups

Understanding **users and groups** in Linux is essential for managing permissions, ensuring security, and maintaining a well-organized system. Hereâ€™s a **complete explanation**:

---

### **1. What Are Users and Groups?**

- **Users**:
    - A **user** is an entity that can log in and perform actions on a Linux system.
    - Each user has a unique **User ID (UID)**.
    - Users can have their files, processes, and permissions.
- **Groups**:
    - A **group** is a collection of users.
    - Groups allow administrators to assign permissions to multiple users simultaneously, simplifying access control.
    - Each group has a unique **Group ID (GID)**.

---

### **2. Types of Users**

1. **Root User**:
    - The superuser with unlimited privileges.
    - UID: `0`.
    - Can perform any operation on the system, such as modifying system files, managing users, and installing software.
2. **System Users**:
    - Created by the system during installation or software installation.
    - UID: Typically `< 1000` (on most distributions).
    - Examples: `daemon`, `bin`, `syslog`.
    - These users are used by services and processes, not humans.
3. **Regular Users**:
    - Created by administrators or during system setup.
    - UID: Typically `>= 1000`.
    - Regular users are meant for human interaction and have limited privileges.

### **3. Types of Groups**

1. **Primary Group**:
    - Every user belongs to a primary group by default.
    - Files created by the user are owned by this group.
    - A user can only have one primary group at a time.
2. **Secondary Groups**:
    - Additional groups a user can belong to.
    - Used to grant extra permissions beyond those of the primary group.
    - A user can belong to multiple secondary groups.

### **4. User and Group Configuration Files**

Linux stores user and group information in specific configuration files:

### **Files for Users**:

1. `/etc/passwd`:
    - Stores user account information.
    - Format:
    
    Example:
        
        ```
        username:x:UID:GID:comment:home_directory:shell
        
        ```
        
        ```
        alice:x:1001:1001:Alice User:/home/alice:/bin/bash
        
        ```
        
        - `username`: The user's login name.
        - `x`: Placeholder for the password (stored in `/etc/shadow`).
        - `UID`: User ID.
        - `GID`: Primary group ID.
        - `comment`: Description or full name of the user.
        - `home_directory`: User's home directory.
        - `shell`: The default shell for the user.
2. `/etc/shadow`:
    - Stores encrypted passwords and password-related information.
    - Format:
    
    Example:
        
        ```
        username:encrypted_password:last_change:min:max:warn:expire:disable
        
        ```
        
        ```
        alice:$6$encrypted_password:18537:0:99999:7:::
        
        ```
        

### **Files for Groups**:

1. `/etc/group`:
    - Stores group information.
    - Format:
    
    Example:
        
        ```
        group_name:x:GID:group_members
        
        ```
        
        ```
        developers:x:1002:alice,bob
        
        ```
        
        - `group_name`: Name of the group.
        - `x`: Placeholder for group password.
        - `GID`: Group ID.
        - `group_members`: Comma-separated list of users in the group.
2. `/etc/gshadow`:
    - Stores group passwords (if used).

### **5. Common Commands for User Management**

### **1. Create a User**:

```bash
sudo adduser username

```

- Adds a new user with a home directory and default settings.

### **2. Delete a User**:

```bash
sudo deluser username

```

- Deletes a user but keeps their files unless `-remove-home` is added.

### **3. Modify a User**:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG groupname username

```

- Adds the user to a secondary group.

### **4. Change Password**:

```bash
sudo passwd username

```

### **5. List All Users**:

```bash
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd

```

---

### **6. Common Commands for Group Management**

### **1. Create a Group**:

```bash
sudo groupadd groupname

```

### **2. Delete a Group**:

```bash
sudo groupdel groupname

```

### **3. Add a User to a Group**:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG groupname username

```

### **4. List All Groups**:

```bash
cut -d: -f1 /etc/group

```

### **7. File Permissions and Ownership**

Linux uses a combination of users, groups, and permissions to control access to files and directories.

### **File Ownership**:

- Each file/directory has:
    1. An **owner** (user).
    2. A **group**.

### **File Permissions**:

- Three types of permissions:
    - `r`: Read.
    - `w`: Write.
    - `x`: Execute.
- Permissions are defined for three entities:
    1. **Owner**: User who owns the file.
    2. **Group**: Group assigned to the file.
    3. **Others**: Everyone else.

### **View File Permissions**:

```bash
ls -l filename

```

Example:

```
-rw-r--r--  1 alice developers 1024 Dec 18 10:00 file.txt

```

- **rw-r--r--**:
    - Owner: `rw` (read, write).
    - Group: `r` (read-only).
    - Others: `r` (read-only).

### **Change Ownership**:

1. **Change File Owner**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo chown newowner filename
    
    ```
    
2. **Change File Group**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo chgrp newgroup filename
    
    ```
    
3. **Change Both**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo chown newowner:newgroup filename
    
    ```
    

### **Change Permissions**:

```bash
chmod 755 filename

```

- `755`: Owner can `read/write/execute`, others can only `read/execute`.

---

### **8. Special Groups**

1. **sudo Group**:
    - Members of the `sudo` group have administrative privileges.
    - Add a user to the `sudo` group:
        
        ```bash
        sudo usermod -aG sudo username
        
        ```
        
2. **wheel Group** (on some distributions):
    - Similar to `sudo`, used for administrative privileges.

---

### **9. Best Practices for Managing Users and Groups**

1. **Use Groups for Permissions**:
    - Avoid assigning permissions to individual users. Use groups to simplify management.
2. **Limit Root Access**:
    - Restrict direct root login via SSH (`PermitRootLogin no` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`).
3. **Periodic Audits**:
    - Regularly review `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`, and `/etc/shadow` for unnecessary users/groups.
4. **Enforce Strong Passwords**:
    - Use tools like `pam_pwquality` to enforce password complexity.
5. **Use ACLs for Advanced Permissions**:
    - For fine-grained access control, use Access Control Lists (ACLs) with the `setfacl` and `getfacl` commands.

### **Conclusion**

Users and groups form the backbone of Linux access control. By effectively managing them, you can enforce strong security policies while maintaining system usability. Let me know if you'd like detailed examples or help with specific configurations!
